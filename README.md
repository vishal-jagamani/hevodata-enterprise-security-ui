# HevoData - Enterprise Grade Security

This project showcases an interactive feature section highlighting **HevoDataâ€™s enterprise-grade security** capabilities with a smooth UI experience built using **Next.js 13 (app router)** and **React** with **TypeScript**.

---

## Overview

The app presents three core security features of HevoData:

- Role-based access control  
- Region-specific pipeline execution  
- Compliance and trusted security  

These features are displayed as interactive cards on the left side, and when a card is selected or auto-cycled, a corresponding illustrative image is shown on the right.

---

## Technical Approach

- **Next.js 13 (app router)** with React functional components using hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- **TypeScript** for strong typing and better developer experience.
- **Component design**:
  - `FeatureSection` handles feature cards with auto-play functionality cycling every 3 seconds.
  - `FeatureCard` represents individual feature items with an active state and click handler.
  - `SecuritySection` dynamically displays the corresponding security feature image based on the selected card.
- Used **Google Fonts (Geist & Geist Mono)** integrated via Next.js font optimization for styling.
- Images and icons are imported and managed as modules (SVGs and Lucide React icons).
- Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design.
- The UI automatically updates the displayed security image on card selection or auto-advance.
- Proper cleanup of timers to avoid memory leaks during component unmount or state changes.
- Accessibility considerations like `aria-label` on loading spinner.

## Key Highlights

- **Auto-play with manual override:** The feature cards cycle automatically every 3 seconds, but user clicks disable auto-play for manual control.
- **Dynamic image rendering:** The `SecuritySection` only renders an image if a valid URL is provided, avoiding unnecessary image loading.
- **Modular and reusable components:** Clear separation of concerns with individual components for cards and image display.
- **SEO-ready:** Metadata setup for SEO with descriptive titles, keywords, and author information.
- **Clean and maintainable codebase:** Adheres to best practices with strong typing, functional components, and React hooks.
